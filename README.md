# scaling-cg
Scaling the crispyness with the giggles of togetherness.

Crispyness continues but the versioning in `go.mod` sucks.
```mod
module github.com/Shivam010/scaling-cg

go 1.14

require github.com/Shivam010/crispy-giggle v1.0.1-0.20200716191249-8825fc4ff8d6

```
instead of 
```mod
module github.com/Shivam010/scaling-cg

go 1.14

require github.com/Shivam010/crispy-giggle v2.0.0
```
